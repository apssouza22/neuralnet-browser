# Training MNIST on the Browser

This project shows how to train a neural network on the browser using Vanilla Neural Network(No library) and TensorFlowJs. 
The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which contains images of handwritten digits. 


This model will compute accuracy over 1000 random test set examples every 5
steps, plotting loss and accuracy as the model is training. Training time can
be reduced by computing accuracy over fewer examples less often.

Note: currently the entire dataset of MNIST images is stored in a PNG image we have
sprited

## Getting Started
run `yarn install` to install all the dependencies.

run `yarn watch` to start the development server
