# Training MNIST on the Browser

This project shows how to train a neural network on the browser using Vanilla Neural Network(No library) and TensorFlowJs. 
The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which contains images of handwritten digits. 

This project lets you train a handwritten digit recognizer using three different model approaches:
- Fully Connected Neural Network - Vanilla Artificial Neural Network(My own implementation)
- Fully Connected Neural Network (also known as a DenseNet) Using TensorFlow.js
- Convolutional Neural Network(also known as a ConvNet or CNN) Using TensorFlow.js

Note: currently the entire dataset of MNIST images is stored in a PNG image
